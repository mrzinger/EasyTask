# Intro
EasyTask Outlook add-in extends standard tasks functionality of Outlook 2007-2021 with ability to specify tasks due dates and categories directly from the task naming, streamlining the tasks management. 
You can specify when you want the task due date by using natural language in the task name.

⚠️The add-in doesn't work with the latest Web Based Outlook where the tasks were replaced with integration with Microsoft To Do. 

Anyway you can look at the code if interested.
Check out `OutlookControlsExtensions` for how to extend standard Outlook edit box functionality with extra features like filtered drop down.
