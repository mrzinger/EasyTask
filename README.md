# Intro
**EasyTask Outlook Add-in** extends the standard task functionality in Outlook (2007â€“2021) by allowing you to specify due dates and categories directly within the task name. This streamlines task management by enabling natural language input to set due dates.

>**Note: The add-in is not compatible with the latest web-based Outlook, where tasks have been replaced by integration with Microsoft To Do.** 

If you're interested in the code, feel free to explore it. Check out the `OutlookControlsExtensions` class to see how to extend the standard Outlook edit box with additional features like a filtered drop-down. To enable the drop-down functionality, make sure to activate the corresponding view in Outlook and restart the application.
